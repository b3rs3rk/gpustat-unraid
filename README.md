# gpustat-unraid
An UnRAID plugin for displaying GPU status

## Prerequisites

#### NVIDIA:
- UnRAID 6.9.0 Beta 34 and below needs one of the following:
  * ~~UNRAID-Nvidia Plugin with Nvidia Kernel Installed~~
  * Custom Kernel build with Nvidia drivers
- UnRAID 6.9.0 Beta 35 and newer needs one of the following:
  * Nvidia Plugin by @ich777 from Community Apps
  * Custom Kernel build with Nvidia drivers

For custom kernel builds, see the original post of the UnRAID-Kernel-Build-Helper [thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92865-support-ich777-nvidiadvbzfsiscsimft-kernel-helperbuilder-docker/).

#### INTEL:
- UnRAID (All Versions)
  * Intel GPU TOP plugin by @ich777 from Community Apps

#### AMD:
- UnRAID (6.9+)
  * RadeonTop plugin by @ich777 from Community Apps

Note: From an UnRAID console if `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA), `intel_gpu_top` (Intel) or `radeontop` (AMD) cannot be found or run for any reason,
the plugin will fail for that vendor. If none of these commands exists, the plugin install will fail.

## Manual Installation
    - No longer supported, install from Community Apps unless beta testing

If any issues occur, visit the support thread [here](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/89453-plugin-gpu-statistics/ "[PLUGIN] GPU Statistics").
